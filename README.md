# Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow API by Google

I've taken some notes from the 'Machine Learning Crash Course with TensorFlow APIs' given by Google. 

Course link: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/

You can read the [Notes](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/Notes) to get the details of this course. 

This course aims to use tensorflow, Below, you can find the scripts:

1. [introduction](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/introduction): basic usage of tensorflow
2. [linear_regression](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/linear_regression): build, train and plot the model
3. how to use [feature_cross](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/feature_cross_script)?
4. Check [fairness](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/fairness) and confusion matrix.
5. Create  [validation set](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/validation_test)
6. Turn a regression problem to classification. Learn [binary classification](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/binary_classification)
7. [Neural network](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/neural_networks)
8. Mnist dataset, [multiclass_classification](https://github.com/pelinbalci/machinelearning/tree/master/multiclass_classification)
