This tutorial demonstrates how to classify structured data (e.g. tabular data in a CSV). We will use 
[Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to define the model, and [feature columns]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns) 
as a bridge to map from columns in a CSV to features used to train the model. This tutorial contains complete code to:

* Load a CSV file using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
* Build an input pipeline to batch and shuffle the rows using [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets).
* Map from columns in the CSV to features used to train the model using feature columns.
* Build, train, and evaluate a model using Keras.

## The Dataset

We will use a small [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) provided by the Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation for Heart Disease. There are several hundred rows in the CSV. Each row describes   a patient, 
and each column describes an attribute. We will use this information to predict whether a patient has heart disease, 
which in this dataset is a binary classification task.

Following is a [description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/heart-disease.names) 
of this dataset. Notice there are both numeric and categorical columns.

>Column| Description| Feature Type | Data Type
>------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------
>Age | Age in years | Numerical | integer
>Sex | (1 = male; 0 = female) | Categorical | integer
>CP | Chest pain type (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) | Categorical | integer
>Trestbpd | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) | Numerical | integer
>Chol | Serum cholestoral in mg/dl | Numerical | integer
>FBS | (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) | Categorical | integer
>RestECG | Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2) | Categorical | integer
>Thalach | Maximum heart rate achieved | Numerical | integer
>Exang | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) | Categorical | integer
>Oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest | Numerical | float
>Slope | The slope of the peak exercise ST segment | Numerical | integer
>CA | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy | Numerical | integer
>Thal | 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect | Categorical | string
>Target | Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = true; 0 = false) | Classification | integer

"""
## Create an input pipeline using tf.data
Next, we will wrap the dataframes with [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets). 
This will enable us  to use feature columns as a bridge to map from the columns in the Pandas dataframe to features 
used to train the model. If we were working with a very large CSV file (so large that it does not fit into memory), 
we would use tf.data to read it from disk directly. That is not covered in this tutorial.

We can see that the dataset returns a dictionary of column names (from the dataframe) that map to column values

### Numeric columns
The output of a feature column becomes the input to the model (using the demo function defined above, 
we will be able to see exactly how each column from the dataframe is transformed). 
A [numeric column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/numeric_column) is the simplest type of 
column. It is used to represent real valued features. 

When using this column, your model will receive the column value from the dataframe unchanged.

"""
In the heart disease dataset, most columns from the dataframe are numeric.

### Bucketized columns
Often, you don't want to feed a number directly into the model, but instead split its value into different categories 
based on numerical ranges. Consider raw data that represents a person's age. 
Instead of representing age as a numeric column, we could split the age into several buckets using a 
[bucketized column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/bucketized_column). 

Notice the one-hot values below describe which age range each row matches.

"""
### Categorical columns
In this dataset, thal is represented as a string (e.g. 'fixed', 'normal', or 'reversible'). We cannot feed strings 
directly to a model. Instead, we must first map them to numeric values. The categorical vocabulary columns provide a way 
to represent strings as a one-hot vector (much like you have seen above with age buckets). 

The vocabulary can be passed as a list using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list), 
or loaded from a file using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file).
"""

thal = feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list('thal', ['fixed', 'normal', 'reversible'])

thal_one_hot = feature_column.indicator_column(thal)
demo(thal_one_hot)

"""
In a more complex dataset, many columns would be categorical (e.g. strings). Feature columns are most valuable when 
with categorical data. Although there is only one categorical column in this dataset, we will use it to demonstrate 
several important types of feature columns that you could use when working with other datasets.

### Embedding columns
Suppose instead of having just a few possible strings, we have thousands (or more) values per category. 
For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using 
one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. 
Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a 
lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1. The size of the embedding 
(8, in the example below) is a parameter that must be tuned.

Key point: using an embedding column is best when a categorical column has many possible values. 
We are using one here for demonstration purposes, so you have a complete example you can modify for a different dataset 
in the future.
"""

# Notice the input to the embedding column is the categorical column
# we previously created
thal_embedding = feature_column.embedding_column(thal, dimension=8)
demo(thal_embedding)

"""
### Hashed feature columns
Another way to represent a categorical column with a large number of values is to use a [categorical_column_with_hash_bucket]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_hash_bucket). 
This feature column calculates a hash value of the input, then selects one of the `hash_bucket_size` buckets to encode 
a string. When using this column, you do not need to provide the vocabulary, and you can choose to make the number of
 hash_buckets significantly smaller than the number of actual categories to save space.

Key point: An important downside of this technique is that there may be collisions in which different strings are 
mapped to the same bucket. In practice, this can work well for some datasets regardless.
"""

thal_hashed = feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket('thal', hash_bucket_size=1000)
demo(feature_column.indicator_column(thal_hashed))

"""### Crossed feature columns
Combining features into a single feature, better known as [feature crosses]
(https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature_cross), enables a model to learn separate weights 
for each combination of features. Here, we will create a new feature that is the cross of age and thal. 
Note that `crossed_column` does not build the full table of all possible combinations (which could be very large). 
Instead, it is backed by a `hashed_column`, so you can choose how large the table is.

crossed_feature = feature_column.crossed_column([age_buckets, thal], hash_bucket_size=1000)
demo(feature_column.indicator_column(crossed_feature))

"""## Choose which columns to use

The goal of this tutorial is to show you the complete code (e.g. mechanics) needed to work with feature columns.

Key point: If your aim is to build an accurate model, try a larger dataset of your own, and think carefully about 
which features are the most meaningful to include, and how they should be represented.

baseline. The goal of this tutorial is not to train an accurate model, but to demonstrate the mechanics of working 
with structured data, so you have code to use as a starting point when working with your own datasets in the future.

## Next steps
The best way to learn more about classifying structured data is to try it yourself. 
We suggest finding another dataset to work with, and training a model to classify it using code similar to the above. 
To improve accuracy, think carefully about which features to include in your model, and how they should be represented.
